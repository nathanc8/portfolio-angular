# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my **personal portfolio** project built with [Angular](https://angular.io/)! I developed this project on personal time during my formation at Ada Tech School.

I'm excited to say that it is available on [Vercel](https://portfolio-angular-cazard-nathan.vercel.app/)!

## 📝 To-dos and ameliorations I want to implement

- **Implement a backend** where projects would be initialized and stocked. This means creating a database, and an API so the frontend would fetch the data from the backend.
- **Privacy policy**
- **About me section** needs to be finished. But my updated resume is available on the home page!
- **Polishing CSS** : I've identified some responsive anomalies that I have to adress, and some basics rules that my portfolio doesn't respect, as not having too long lines (or else it's not enjoyable to read on a big screen).
- **Multilingual support**
- **Unit Testing** : write unit tests for importants components using Jasmine and Karma.
