## 📝 To-dos and ameliorations I want to implement

- **Implement a backend** where projects would be initialized and stocked. This means creating a API so the frontend would fetch the data from the backend.
- **About me section** needs to be done. But my updated resume is available on the home page!
- **Multilingual support**
- **Unit Testing** : write unit tests for importants components using Jasmine and Karma
